# travel_game
A little game where the goal is to catch MrX across the train network of Switzerland.
 
Here is a nice map that helps understand the connections: https://network.sbb.ch/de/


Todo:
- fix the issue that a train line only shows one direction (timetable.get_departures)
- open the network.sbb.ch site when starting the game.
